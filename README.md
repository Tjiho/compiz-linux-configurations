Linux desktop configuration
===========================

This is my configs for Compiz WM with tint2.

Files in config dir need to be copy to `~/.config`

`start-compiz.sh` needs to be launch in the `.xinitrc`

`desWall.sh` and `wall.sh` are scripts which manage wallpaper

Software i'm using

* terminology because it's a fun powerful terminal emulator.
* albert because it just works, and he have a funny name.
* qualculate because it's a powerful calculate which works simply.
